Collection Framework Overview

Enter : List implementation classes : ArrayList

Test basic API using Integer List n then apply it to vehicle showroom scenario.

Objective 
0. Simplify invocation of validations from the tester.(code refactoring)
eg : validate all inputs.

1. Create empty AL to store vehicles in a showroom

2. Accept  vehicle details from user n store it in AL(along with validation rules)
No dups please !

2.5 After testing vehicle registration in showroom , add sample data to store 5 vehicles in the showroom.

Using for-each & also using Iterator

4. Fetch Vehicle details from AL
i/p : PK (chasis no)
o/p : in case of success : display vehicle details o.w throw custom exception
Hint : indexOf , get
