Revise enum
eg :
public enum Color
{RED,GREEN,BLUE}

What is it ? : keyword , related set of self typed constants.
It's a special class generated by javac that extends --- java.lang.Enum

Which is the implicit super class ?java.lang.Enum

Implicit constructor : private , 
args : name , ordinal
super(name,ordinal)

Data Members : 3
eg : public static final Color RED , GREEN,BLUE;

Methods : public static Color[] values()
public static Color valueOf(String name) throws IllegalArgumentExc : un checked exc

static init block : 
static {
 RED=new Color("RED",0);
 
}

Which methods can be overridden ? : toString

Which methods can not be overridden? : equals, compareTo

Which i/fs it implements  ? Comparable
eg :
public enum Color
{RED,GREEN,BLUE}
In a Tester class : 
import static com.app.core.Color.*;
sop(RED.compareTo(BLUE));// -1

Can you add enum nested within a class or interface ? YES (implicitly it's treated as static member)
eg : class Outer
{
  ....
    enum Color
  {RED,GREEN,BLUE}
}

How to access BLUE ? Outer.Color.BLUE


1. Solve Food Bill generation using additional features of enum
eg : Food Bill Generation

2. Establish HAS-A relation between 
Vehicle & DeliveryAddress
(one to one association)

Steps
1. Create a separate class : DeliveryAddress -- city,state,country,zipCode
constr , toString

2. To establish association(containment) between Vehicle & DeliveryAddress 
Add new state (instance var) : DeliveryAddress  
Don't init it in the constr.(since delivery address should be assigned when customer purchases a vehicle)

3. Add a method to link delivery address to a vehicle.

4. Write a simple tester to test this form of association.
Confirm :In this case ,  can a DeliveryAddress exist w/o a Vehicle ?
If yes : how will you prevent it ?


Enter Nested classes


5. Add Option in Tester
Purchase Vehicle
i/p : vehicle's chasis no 
In case of valid chasis no , if the vehicle is not already sold , accept delivery address details & assign it to the vehicle.
o/p : in case of invalid chasis no or vehicle already sold --throw custom exc
o.w : assign delivery address &  give success message.

6. Discuss rules of non static nested class (inner class)

7. wrapper classes

8. Generics
